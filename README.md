## Dynamic Sales Analysis Dashboard
The centerpiece of this project is the interactive dashboard created with Power BI. The dashboard presents an intuitive and visually appealing layout, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive view of sales metrics and trends. With dynamic filters, drill-down capabilities, and interactive visualizations, users can effortlessly explore the data, identify patterns, and gain valuable insights.

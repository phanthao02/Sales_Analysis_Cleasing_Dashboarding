# Data Cleansing and Dashboarding for Sales Analysis

This repository contains the code and project files for my personal project focused on data cleansing and dashboarding for sales analysis. The project aims to extract and transform data from multiple related tables, enhance the reporting process, and provide stakeholders with actionable insights through interactive dashboards created with Power BI.

## Key Features
* Utilized SQL to extract and cleanse data from 5 different related tables from the sales analysis databases.
* Employed various data transformation techniques, such as aggregating and filtering functions, to enhance the reporting process, ensuring improved data accuracy and consistency for robust sales analysis.
* Developed interactive dashboards using Power BI to present sales metrics and trends, empowering stakeholders to gain practical insights and make informed business decisions.

## Dynamic Sales Analysis Dashboard
The centerpiece of this project is the interactive dashboard created with Power BI. The dashboard presents an intuitive and visually appealing layout, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive view of sales metrics and trends. With dynamic filters, drill-down capabilities, and interactive visualizations, users can effortlessly explore the data, identify patterns, and gain valuable insights. The screenshot below captures a snapshot of the dashboard, showcasing its visuals, key performance indicators, and the ability to explore sales data across different dimensions.
